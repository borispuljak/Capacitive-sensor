Capacitive distance sensors are increasingly used with the advancement of technology due to their many advantages such as low power consumption, precision, speed, etc. They work on the principle of observing the change in capacitance between the sensor and the object when the object approaches or moves away from it. In the practical part of the work, a prototype of a directional capacitive sensor was created and controlled by an Arduino Uno microcontroller. Measurements related to the functionality of the assembly were carried out, observing the voltage values and forms depending on the position of the object in relation to the sensor. Based on the measurement results, it was concluded that the ideal distance between the sensor and reference plate is 1 cm and that then the sensor reads the object at a distance of 30 cm or closer.
